<h2>Q: What is Project Preludio 2017?</h2>
<p>A: Project Preludio 2017 is a desktop computer game, created with the Java programming language, aiming to teach basic and fundamental music theory to users of all skill levels and backgrounds. You can learn more about Project Preludio in the About section.
</p>

<h2>Q: How do I install Project Preludio 2017?</h2>
<p>A: Go to the Download page and download the .zip file. The .zip file contains the necessary game files, compressed into one file called Preludio.jar, and the game folder structure already created so the game can save and do other necessary operations. The sample .midi and other files that come with the game are also located within the .zip file. After downloading, extract the .zip file to whatever location you want on your computer. Whenever you want to play, just run the Preludio.jar file by double clicking it and the game should start. 
</p>
<p>Please Note: You must have the Java 8 JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed on your computer so that your computer knows how to run a .jar file. Please consult Oracle’s website on installation instructions for your Operating System:

<h2>Q: How do I get more songs to play in Project Preludio 2017?</h2>
<p>A: Project Preludio allows you to use any .midi file to play songs, however please note they need to have “note on” and “note off” encoded values in the file due to the way the game’s parser works, otherwise the game may crash. The game allows you to choose a file from anywhere on your computer, however we recommend placing your .midi files in the Resources folder from the game’s .zip file structure for convenience.
