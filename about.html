 <h1>About </h1>
 <p>Project Preludio 2017 is a desktop computer game, created with the Java programming language, aiming to teach basic and fundamental music theory to users of all skill levels and backgrounds. The game can be used for more advanced users as a refresher course on music theory or a new user who has no previous knowledge to learn the concepts from the beginning. The game features a rhythm game mode where players play along with songs to learn rhythm and pitch, a lesson mode where users learn concepts such as intervals, note names, etc., a concert mode where the game will play a song (as a .midi) for the player to show how it would be played on a keyboard and how it sounds, and a free play mode where the player can practice what they have learned. Records of scores and general game statistics are also saved both locally on the playerâ€™s computer to be viewed in game, and on the website in the scoreboard section (if the player logs in when starting the game).
