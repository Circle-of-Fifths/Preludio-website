		<p>Project Preludio 2017 is a desktop computer game, created with the Java programming language. It aims to teach basic and fundamental music theory to users of all skill levels and backgrounds.
		<p>The game can be used for more advanced users as a refresher course on music theory or a new user who has no previous knowledge to learn the concepts from the beginning.
		<p>The game features a rhythm game mode where players play along with songs to learn rhythm and pitch, a lesson mode where users learn concepts such as intervals, note names, etc., a concert mode where the game will play songs (as .midi files) for the player to show how it would be played on a keyboard and how it sounds, and a free play mode where the player can practice what they have learned.
		<p>Records of scores and general game statistics are also saved both locally on the playerâ€™s computer to be viewed in game, and on the website in the scoreboard section (if the player logs in when starting the game).
